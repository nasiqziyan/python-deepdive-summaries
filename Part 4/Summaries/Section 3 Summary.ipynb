    "- accounts are uniquely identified by an **account number** (assume it will just be passed in the initializer)\n",
    "- account holders have a **first** and **last** name\n",
    "- accounts have an associated **preferred time zone offset** (e.g. -7 for MST)\n",
    "- **balances** need to be zero or higher, and should not be directly settable.\n",
    "- but, **deposits** and **withdrawals** can be made (given sufficient funds)\n",
    "    - if a withdrawal is attempted that would result in nagative funds, the transaction should be declined.\n",
    "- a **monthly interest rate** exists and is applicable to all accounts **uniformly**. There should be a method that can be called to calculate the interest on the current balance using the current interest rate, and **add it** to the balance.\n",
    "- each deposit and withdrawal must generate a **confirmation number** composed of:\n",
    "    - the transaction type: `D` for deposit, and `W` for withdrawal, `I` for interest deposit, and `X` for declined (in which case the balance remains unaffected)\n",
    "    - the account number\n",
    "    - the time the transaction was made, using UTC\n",
    "    - an incrementing number (that increments across all accounts and transactions)\n",

    "    - the account number, transaction code (D, W, etc), datetime (UTC format), date time (in whatever timezone is specified in te argument, but more human readable), the transaction ID\n",
