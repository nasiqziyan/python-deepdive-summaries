Up till now, we've worked from main.py and we saw that any import statements would look in the system cache. This system cache is not exclusive to main.py. In fact, if we create a brand new python file, that file too will have access to this system cache. So, theoretically, we could use our own manual importer in main.py to create a reference to a module. Then, we can use Python's inbuilt importer in a completely different file to look up that reference in the system cache. It will find the module because all files will have access to this cache."

Sure, you can delete it from sys modules (e.g. `del sys.modules['test_module']`) but it will still exist in the global namespace. It gets unnecessarily complicated. If you must, then use `importlib.reload(test)` which will re-execute the module and assign it to the same memory address as before. But this still is unnecessary."

Our functional code should go in modules and our `__init__.py` should do `from <module> import *`. Take a look at the `asyncio` package to see good practice.\n",
