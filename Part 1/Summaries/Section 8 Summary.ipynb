    "The first important thing to know about tuples, besides the fact that they're immutable strings, is that they're data records; the positions of values in a tuple have a meaning. Because they're immutable, this prevents the 1st element from ending up in the 2nd position, for example. This makes tuples more similar to strings than lists. They both have fixed order and fixed length. We can't do in-place sorts or in-place reversals (without creating a new tuple). \n",
