Then, when we reach the free variable `n` within the `lambda`, Python knows that it must point to the same `n` that `loop.n` points to. We established that `loop.n` is pointing to a cell that points to `2`, therefore `lambda.n` must now point to the same cell which points to `2`. Nothing is pointing to the integer `1` anymore! In fact, the cell will only point to the object created during the last iteration of the loop.\n",

The `count` in `inc1` and `inc2` both point to the same place as `count` in `outer`'s scope. They all point to a python cell. Here we have 4 different closures, all of which have an `lambda.n` which point to the same place as `create_adders.n` (local variable). So, these 5 references (4 `lambda.n` and 1 local variable `n`) all point to a python cell which initially points to an integer object with value `1`. Then, the loop statement makes `n = 2` so Python goes through the local branch and makes all 5 references now point to a new integer object of value `2`. And so on and so forth.."

Here, we only want one thing: the partial solution after `n` foldings because each folding corresponds to generating the next term in the fibonacci sequence. It is basically recursion.

We must remember to give `self` because when we create a method manually, we write: `def some_method(self, other_params):`. This `self` will take the object that called it. If you can't remember this from earlier, just remember that all methods need to take `self` as their first parameter, and that it's easiest to think of `def info(self):` as a method as if you were directly writing it into your own class. ."

In short, adding `@property` to some method `def value(self)` which returns `self.value` means that when users seemingly call an attribute `obj.value`, it is infact looking for the `value` method which returns the `self.value` attribute. This makes the class more dynamic, and it's a good habit to get all attributes that may change using a getter. The reason why is because if we have an attribute that is made from other attributes, then this attribute won't get updated if the other attributes are updated because all attributes are initialised only once.\n",

This means that we can stack other decorators e.g. `@htmlize.register(tuple)` on top of `@htmlize.register(int)`  and it will first decorate it with `@htmlize.register(int)`, returning the original function so that it can be decorated again by `@htmlize.register(tuple)`.

    "Our single dispatch decorator works quite well - but it has some limitations. For example it cannot handle functions that take in more than one argument (in which case dispatching would be based on the type of the **first** argument), and we also are not allowing for types based on parent classes - for example, integers and booleans are both integral numbers - i.e. they both inherit from the Integral base class. Similarly lists and tuples are both more generic Sequence types. We'll see this in more detail when we get to the topic of abstract base classes (ABC's).\n",

    "As mentioned at the start of this section, Python already has an implementation for singledispatch which is imported using `from functools import singledispatch`. It is a decorator that decorates some function, which we've called `htmlize`. Then, this decorated function accepts different types e.g. bool, int, str etc. It will then let us write a function for each of these types that will execute when this type is passed to `htmlize`. If we haven't written any functions, then it will default to `htmlize`.\n",

In this function, we apply the function `htmlize(item)` for each item. The first item is 'a', so we call `htmlize('a')` which is a string which is an instance of `Sequence`, so we use the `html_sequence` function. There's only one item in the sequence but still we apply `htmlize(item)` on this item. So this recurses indefinitely."

So, the names of them are unimportant and infact, we'd prefer that other users know that they're not supposed to access them directly. So you may often see *all* of these functions renamed with `_` to indicate that this is (pseudo)private. Even if all these functions have the same name, they will still execute perfectly through `singledispatch` because Python doesn't refer to functions by their labels but what those labels point to in memory.\n",
